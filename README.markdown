# xmldiff

xmldiff is a Scala library (and utility) for diff-ing two XML trees.

xmldiff was originally released by Google. I've forked it and migrated the
project to GitHub to bring it to a larger community of developers. Please feel
free to send pull requests.

The original version is available at: http://code.google.com/p/xml-test/
